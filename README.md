# Quickstart Resources

A repository of servers and clients from the following Model Context Protocol tutorials:
- [Quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) – a simple MCP weather server
- [Building MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/tutorials/building-a-client) – an LLM-powered chatbot MCP client

## Security Note

These examples are intentionally minimal. If you expose an MCP server over a network (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket), add authentication and basic hardening (CORS allowlist, request size limits, timeouts, rate limits, and log redaction). See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
